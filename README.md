## M3_Example.
The M3_Example is used to understand Mode 3 of the GBA's video modes, based on the tutorial in (https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm). 
In mode 3, the GBA uses a bitmap of  240 X 160 pixels, each pixel is 16bit long. In this mode, there is no pageflipping. 
If you will run the example on the emulator, a lot of flickering will happen. In the example we show a cube that is rotating around the y-axis.
